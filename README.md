# DriveSafe-App

This Repository holds all the files for this Android App.

Overview:

For our project our group decided to approach the current real-world problem of drivers distracting themselves by texting while driving.  Our proposed solution was to develop an Android app that would limit the user’s ability to text when the phone detects that they driving.  To determine whether or not the user was driving, we decided to use the GPS of the Android phone and have the app enable or disable the user’s ability to text based on whether they were moving below or above a predetermined speed.  We defined this speed to be 20 miles per hour for the reason that in the United States this is the speed limit while driving in a school zone, where drivers arguably need to be the most attentive.
